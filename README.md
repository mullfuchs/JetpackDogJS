# JetpackDogJS
## A browser game by Leo Burke

Jetpack dog is a recreation of a flash game I made a few years ago. 

## Technologies Used

Jetpack dog uses the [Phaser javascript game library](phaser.io). All graphics were done by me, with sounds created in the SFXR application. 

## Best experiences

Implementing "screenshake" details on the second to last day to make my game really shine was very satisfying to do.

## Worst experiences

Code base kind of ballooned and got a little bloated near the end, had I known how Phaser did certain things I would have been able to make things more organized

## If I had more time, what would I add?

Sprite animations, a boss battle, and melee attacks. I would tune the game's difficulty as well. I had a small list of features I ended up cutting due to time.
